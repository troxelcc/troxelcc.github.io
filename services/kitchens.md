We remodel kitchens and bathrooms. But bathrooms are on a different page. They're only mentioned here because I copied that first sentence out of the old website. I could've just deleted "and bathrooms", and that would've been easier than typing all this. But this way you get to see what it'd look like if there were a nice big introductory paragraph about the stuff you can do in kitchens.
