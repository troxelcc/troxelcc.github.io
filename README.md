#  Hi Uncle Dan
## This is where your website lives behind the scenes
To change a page, first go to it on the website, and find the last bit of the URL (like "windows-doors"). Then look in the list of files above and find the .md file with the same name. Click on it, change it, and actually I'm going to refrain from further directions until I've figured this stuff out more myself.
